        <h1>Howdy.</h1>
        <p>I'm a lot of things. But, above all, I'm a husband and father.</p>
        <p>
          In my career, I want to champion and create software that{" "}
          <em>works</em>â€”like really well. It's all about reducing the friction between users and their tools.
        </p>
        <h3>Free time</h3>
        <p>
          On the weekends, I like to take my kids out in the bike trailer to new
          and exciting places.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the occasional TikTok or YouTube video.  
        </p>
        <h3>Leave it better than you found it.</h3>
        <p>
          It's sort of my motto. I spy a typo, I fix it. I think of a better
          way, I pitch it. I see some litter, I pick it up. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the right thing to do, I figure. We're all in this together,
          after all.
        </p>
