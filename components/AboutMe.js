        <h1>Hi, the name's Brad.</h1>
        <p>I'm a lot of things. But, above all, I'm a husband and father.</p>
        <p>
          In my career, I want to champion and create not just software, but
          software that <em>works</em>â€”like really well.
        </p>
        <h3>Free time</h3>
        <p>
          On the weekends, I like to take my kids out in the bike trailer to new
          and exciting places.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy the occasional TikTok or YouTube video. Some of my favorites
          lately are
          <ul>
            <li>

        </p>
        <h3>Leave it better than you found it.</h3>
        <p>
          It's the motto I can't seem to stop living by. ðŸ˜… I find a typo, I let
          somebody know. I see some litter, I pick it up. I think of a better
          way, I pitch it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the right thing to do, I figure. We're all in this together,
          after all.
        </p>
