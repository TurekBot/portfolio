          Jumping spiders are like dogs. They can bite you, but they generally
          don’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning about and adopting one of these little finger kittens
          myself, I made this poster intended to be put up in a{" "}
          <strong>pet store</strong> selling jumping spiders. We all have this
          irrational fear of spiders, but something about these little jumping
          spiders seems to win people over. Just ask Bea the Jumping Spider,{" "}
          <a href={bea}>she’s Tik-Tok famous</a> and has cured many people’s
          arachnophobia. That’s the kind of magic I hoped to capture in this
          poster.

          As you can see, my <strong>first draft</strong> wasn’t very good. As
          my instructor put it, “you might have to put your nose on the poster
          just to read the print.” I was trying to draw the audience in and make
          them curious... They were probably just confused. I had missed the
          mark.

          However, I was determined, and despite visual design and the
          principles and tools that go along with it being new to me, I dug in
          and <strong>tried again</strong>. With each draft, it looked better
          and with a lot of practice I found it getting easier and easier.

          I’m proud to present the final poster: I traced both spiders by hand
          with a mouse in Illustrator. I created balance and depth with the
          squares and colors. I worked hard to make the poster{" "}
          <strong>brief yet striking.</strong>

              alt='A poster with a large orange, &qout;Psst..." at the top of it and then three large squares along the bottom. The first square is pink and has a line art, curious-looking jumping spider just barely protruding out of it. There is a small white heart in the upper right corner of this square. In the middle square, which is orange, it reads, "Regal Jumpers make great Pets. They&apos;re cute and soft, come in fun colors, and are low maintainance.". In the last square, which is pink, there is a QR code labeled, "Here&apos;s a video of all the fun colors they come in." Peeking from behind this square you can see a peachy ombre jumping spider head.'
