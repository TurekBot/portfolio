          Ahem, I mean they‚Äôre the kids in America. (In case you‚Äôre lost, that
          line is from a popular song; I heard it first in the Jimmy Neutron
          movie back in 2001. It was a classic for my generation and this song
          has stuck with me ever since.)

          This map is the result of one of my first dives into data
          visualization. Let me pull back the curtain a bit on how I did it.{" "}
        </p>
        <figure>
          <a target="_blank" href="/images/üë∂ lt 18‚ÄîChoropleth Map.svg">
            <img
              className="zoom-worthy-image"
              alt="TODO"
              src="/images/üë∂ lt 18‚ÄîChoropleth Map.svg"
            />
          </a>
          <figcaption>
            This kind of "zoned heat map" is called a choropleth map.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          To create this map, I used the data-oriented R programming language. I
          used data collected by the Census Bureau and was careful in my
          massaging of the data to not try to get it to say anything it didn‚Äôt
          truly support.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I started off by showing the number of children by state, but then I
          realized that that wasn't a fair comparison because of course the
          states with bigger populations would have more children: California
          was lit up like a Christmas tree. To make the state-by-state
          comparison fair, <b>I controlled for population</b>; this
          left me with a map that showed not the number of children, but the
          proportion of children (to adults).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I got the unrefined map from R Studio, I brought it into Adobe
          Illustrator to give it some careful final touches. I gave it a modern
          font and added a call-out that elaborated on the most salient piece of
          the data: Utah. When controlled for population,{" "}
          <b>Utah pops right out</b> as the leader by a huge margin.
          Having grown up in Utah, I succinctly offered some speculation as to
          why this might be, but I also noted that the data does not mean this
          necessarily.
